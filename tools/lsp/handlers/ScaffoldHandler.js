  documentation: `
    workspace/executeCommand 'foam.scaffold.newClass' — create a new FOAM
    class file and register it in the nearest pom.js.

    Given { dir, name } it returns { edit, result }:
      edit   — a WorkspaceEdit with documentChanges
               [ CreateFile, TextDocumentEdit (the file's whole content),
                 TextDocumentEdit (the pom.js files: append) ]. The server
               hands it to the client via workspace/applyEdit; NOTHING is
               written to disk here, so the user's undo stack owns the change
               and an editor with unsaved buffers stays coherent.
      result — { created: <uri>, pomUpdated: bool, warning?: string }, the
               executeCommand response the caller (VS Code command, MCP,
               Zed) reports to the user.

    Three derivations, each deliberately source-driven rather than
    hardcoded:

      license header — copied VERBATIM from the leading block comment of the
        first sibling .js file in the same folder whose comment reads as a
        LICENSE (see harvestHeader_). Nothing product-specific is baked into
        this public code: a foam3 folder yields the FOAM Authors header, a
        downstream product folder yields that product's header. No such
        sibling → no header at all, plus a warning (inventing one, or
        promoting a class doc-comment to "license", would be worse than
        omitting it).

      package — the path below the last 'src' segment, dotted
        (…/src/foam/demo → foam.demo). No 'src' segment → the path below the
        nearest pom.js's own directory, which is how a pom-rooted tree names
        its entries anyway. Neither available → the folder's own name.

      pom entry — { name: '<path below the pom dir, no .js>', flags: 'js|java' }
        appended inside the pom's files: array. Anything ambiguous (no
        pom.js above the folder, no files: key, two foam.POM() calls, a
        duplicated files: key, an unterminated array) leaves the pom
        UNTOUCHED and reports pomUpdated:false with a warning naming the
        manual entry — a half-edited pom is worse than one the user
        finishes by hand.

    Client requirement: CreateFile is a resource operation, so a client that
    does not declare workspace.workspaceEdit.resourceOperations 'create'
    will decline the applyEdit. The server surfaces that decline as an error
    message rather than a silent no-op.
