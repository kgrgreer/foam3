<title>Store and Forward(SF/SAF)</title>

<h1>Overview</h1>
Store and forward is a data communication technique in which a message transmitted from a source node is stored at an intermediary device before being forwarded to the destination node.
In Nanopay, we use SAF for thing that you want to retry until it processes successfully.
SAF is also using in Medusa system by default, in which message can broadcase from one mediator to other mediators.

<h1>SAF in general</h1>

<h2>How it works</h2>
When SF receives a request, it will record the request into journal first(see: foam.box.sf.SF.storeAndForward method).
And then, the request will be inserted into internal queue in SFManager by SF(see: foam.box.sf.SF.storeAndForward method).
A thread in SFManager will constantly pull request from queue and process it(see: foam.box.sf.SFManager.initForwarder method).
The way that the SAF system diagnoses a success request process, is to check if there will be an exception throwing out from foam.box.sf.SF.submit method.
If no exception, then the request is done and SFManager will pick next request to process. Otherwise, SFManager will process it again after certain given time.

<h2>Key Classes</h2>
<ul>
<li>foam.box.sf.SFEntry</li>
<li>foam.box.sf.SF</li>
<li>foam.box.sf.SFManager</li>
</ul>
SFEntry: use to store request/data/object that will be processed by SF.
SF: key class in SAF system. use to define how to process a request. If you want to customize your own SF, you will need to create a sub-class of SF and override its submit method.
SFManager: manage all SF requests and invoke SF process.

<h2>How to create your own SAF</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Creating sub-class of foam.box.sf.SF, and override submit method for thing you want to implement.</li>
  <li>Registering it into storeAndForwards.jrl</li>
  <li>Using SFManager nspec service to get SF that you define in storeAndForwards.jrl[code: ((SFManager) x.get("sfManager")).getSfs().get("input SF id");]</li>
</ol>

<h1>SAF in Medusa</h1>
The SAF system is built into the Medusa system by default.
In the medusa, SAF is being use to broadcast data from one mediator to others.
DAOs can be set to use SAF to directly broadcast data from mediator itself instead of going to Medusa node.
Important: SAF do not guerantee consistency for the data. If you use SAF for a DAO, please make sure that the data is less important.

<h2>Key Classes</h2>
<ul>
<li>foam.nanos.medusa.sf.MedusaSFManager</li>
<li>foam.nanos.medusa.sf.SFBroadcastDAO</li>
<li>foam.nanos.medusa.sf.SFBroadcastReceiverDAO</li>
</ul>

<h2>How it works</h2>
To use SAF in Medusa is easy, because it is already added into EasyDAO setup.
There is a property in EasyDAO called "SAF", just need to set it to true.
Important: SAF only in this case only takes care of forwarding message to other mediators.
           If you want to presist the data, you also need to set up journal type in easyDAO setup.

<h3>Example: </h3>
in service.jrl
p({
  "class":"foam.nanos.boot.NSpec",
  "name":"localEmailMessageDAO",
  "serviceScript":"""
    return new foam.dao.EasyDAO.Builder(x)
      .setOf(foam.nanos.notification.email.EmailMessage.getOwnClassInfo())
      .setAuthorize(false)
      .setFuid(true)
      .setJournalType(foam.dao.JournalType.SINGLE_JOURNAL)                 //Set journalType for persistence
      .setJournalName("emailMessages")
      .setSAF(true)                                                        //Turn on SAF in medusa
      .setServiceProviderAware(false)
      .setFixedSize(new foam.dao.FixedSizeDAO.Builder(x)
        .setComparator(foam.mlang.MLang.DESC(foam.nanos.notification.email.EmailMessage.CREATED) )
        .setSize(100000)
        .build())
      .build()
      .addPropertyIndex(new foam.core.PropertyInfo[] {foam.nanos.notification.email.EmailMessage.CREATED});
