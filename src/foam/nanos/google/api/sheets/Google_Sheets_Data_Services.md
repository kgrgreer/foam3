#Google Sheets template
To create a Google Sheet template:
1. Create a new sheet with Google Sheets or use excisting one
2. Leave first sheet empty. There should be nothing in there
3. Add your formula, charts and any other components of template on sheets other then first one
4. Make your sheet accesible to anyone
5. Go to back office -> Admin -> Report Template -> Create new template
6. For id use your google sheet id
for DAO use DAO that is used by a table which you want to export to Google Sheets
for name use any name but keep in mind it's visible to user and will appear in template selection for drop box in GoogleSheetsBasedExportDriver
7. Save template
In case it's not visible in template dropdown make sure you used correct daoName
