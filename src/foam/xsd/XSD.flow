<h1>XSD XML Java Generation</h1>
FOAM supports processing XML XSD to produce Java source files.

See foam/xsd/XSD.js

XSD.js supports compiling a single xsd file or a directory of xsd files.

package is the java package prefix of all generated source files

Compiling a single xsd file


Compiling a directory of xsd files

xsdPath is the directory containing xsd files to process. All files in this directory will be compiled.

foam.XSD({
  package: 'net.example.payroll.tax.ca.cra.v2023',
  xsdPath: '../../../../example/src/net/example/payroll/tax/ca/cra/v2023/xsd'
});

The foam.XSD directive is specified in an xsd.js file which is included in a pom.js.

foam.POM({
  name: "v2023",
  files: [
    { name: "xsd",                  flags: "genjava" },
    { name: "T4",                   flags: "java|js" },
    { name: "T4Generator",         flags: "java|js" }
  ]
});
