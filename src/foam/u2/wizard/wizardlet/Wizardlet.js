        Convey an intent to save this wizardlet. The destination will depend on
        the subclass of wizardlet, or a provided WAO.

        This method takes arguments in the form of a plain object. The following
        properties will affect how the wizardlet is saved:

        - **disposable**: If true, this save should be ignored during an
          ongoing operation. If false or unspecified, this save should be
          enqueued during an ongoing operation.
        - **reloadData**: If true, the wizardlet will reload data from the
          server after saving. This should be used sparingly, as an expected
          reload blocks user input to prevent data loss.

        if the wizardlet was related to a choice which the user de-selected.

        This method is not to be disposable, and will not invoke a reload.
