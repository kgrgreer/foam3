# FOAM3

Build fully featured high performance apps in less time using FOAM.

  * Application Speed
  * Application Size
  * Developer Efficiency

"Fast apps Fast"

FOAM3 is the active version of FOAM.

The FOAM1 [website](https://foam-framework.github.io/foam/) still contains many useful demos and videos (but some links may be broken).

Ask questions and get help on the [FOAM Discussion Group](https://groups.google.com/g/foam-framework-discuss). Or DeepWiki.

## Feature Oriented Active Modeller

FOAM is a modeling tool and class based object system.  To use FOAM,
you create a model of your class by describing the properties, methods,
event topics, listeners, and dependencies of your class.  FOAM takes
this model and generates a usable JavaScript class along with several
companion features such as database support and network marshaling.

While FOAM is written in JavaScript, it can be used to generate code
for any language or platform, including Android Java and iOS Swift.

# Development
## Dependencies

FOAM has no runtime dependencies, but does have build dependencies:

* git
* npm
* nodejs (version >= 16)
* maven
* java (version >= 21)

Once dependencies are installed, update FOAM's javascript dependencies:
From the root of the FOAM repository, execute:

    ./build.sh --install

    sudo chown -R $USER /opt

See [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) for more detailed installation notes.

## Building
### Build and run Java webserver

    ./build.sh -Jdemo

* visit: http://localhost:8080
* login with username `admin` and password `admin`

`    ./build.sh`

* visit: http://localhost:8080/foam3/src/foam/demos/index.html


#### common build options:

* **-h** - help, show all options
* **-c** - clean
* **-d** - debug mode allowing connection by a remote debugger
* **-j** - delete runtime journals (use with caution)
* **-Jpom1,pom2,...,pomN** - where pomN,... are found relative to the deployment folder. 
* **-a** - build and deploy from a single Java jar file. 

## Creating and running an example Application

**NOTE: this will create a parent directory above foam3/**

    ./build.sh -T+setup/Project --appName:Example --package:com.foamdev --adminPassword:badpassword
    cd ..
    ./build.sh

* visit: http:/localhost:8080 and login with admin / badpassword

### Run in Docker

The project also includes a `Dockerfile`. The image builds the app and runs it from the JARs, with journals, logs and documents as volumes:

    docker build -t example .
    docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 -v example-journals:/opt/example/journals example

### Deploy with one click

Every project created this way includes a `Dockerfile.vercel` for
[Vercel](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/container-images) and an `app.json`
for the [Cloud Run Button](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-run-button),
so it deploys as is. Try the live demo at https://foam3-demo.vercel.app, or
deploy your own copy of the template repository with one click:

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https://github.com/foam-foundation/foam3-template&project-name=foam3-demo&repository-name=foam3-demo)
[![Run on Google Cloud](https://deploy.cloud.run/button.svg)](https://deploy.cloud.run?git_repo=https://github.com/foam-foundation/foam3-template)

Add your models under `src/` and push; the host rebuilds and redeploys.

Vercel runs the container as a function: it scales to zero after 5 minutes
without traffic, only `/tmp` is writable, and requests are spread over several
instances that share no memory. FOAM keeps sessions in the JVM, so a login on
one instance is unknown to the next. `Dockerfile.vercel` therefore sets
`SESSION_DEFAULT_USER` to the admin, and `-Dsession.defaultUser` signs every
new session in as that user, which suits a demo and nothing else. Cloud Run
keeps one instance (`max-instances` in `app.json`), so sessions and logins
work as usual there.

## Running Application Controller

The FOAM Application Controller allows you to access components of your foam
app by using the browser & displaying it as a GUI.
To access, run the following in the parent directory of foam3:
-->

## Remote deployment

To build and deploy to a remote linux instance

1. build: `./build.sh -ck[Jpom...]`
1. deploy: `./build.sh -TStandard,RemoteInstall,Java --user:foam user-id:3636 --remote-hostname:hostname`
1. visit: http://hostname:8080

## Style Guide

All code should follow the [style guide.](doc/guides/StyleGuide.md)

## Testing
To run all, Java and Javacript, tests from the command-line, run:
`./build.sh --run-tests`

To run individual tests from the command-line, run:
`./build.sh --run-tests:testName1,testName2,...testNameN`

<!--
* _npm test_ runs standard unit tests.

* _npm run testDebug_ runs the unit tests with a debugger.

* _npm run coverage_ runs code coverage and creates an html report in /coverage.

For in-browser testing, run your favorite web server at the root of the FOAM
repository. In a browser, navigate to
[http://localhost:8080/test/browser/SpecRunner.html](http://localhost:8000/test/browser/SpecRunner.html)
to run the unit tests.
