# FOAM3

Build fully featured high performance apps in less time using FOAM.

  * Application Speed
  * Application Size
  * Developer Efficiency

"Fast apps Fast"

FOAM3 is the active version of FOAM.

The FOAM1 [website](https://foam-framework.github.io/foam/) still contains many useful demos and videos (but some links may be broken).

## Feature Oriented Active Modeller

FOAM is a modeling tool and class based object system.  To use FOAM,
you create a model of your class by describing the properties, methods,
event topics, listeners, and dependencies of your class.  FOAM takes
this model and generates a usable JavaScript class along with several
companion features such as database support and network marshaling.

While FOAM is written in JavaScript, it can be used to generate code
for any language or platform, including Android Java and iOS Swift.

# Development
<!--
## Building Java

cd src; ./gen.sh; cd ../build; cp ../tools/pom.xml .; mvn compile; mvn package

Or you may build and run using

make run

And to clean the project, you may use

make clean

## Installing Dependencies

FOAM has no runtime dependencies, but uses a number of third party tools for
unit tests, code coverage, and linting.  You can install all required
tools by doing the following.

* Install nodejs.

* Run 'npm install' in the root of the FOAM repository, where
  package.json is found.

## Running Application Controller

The FOAM Application Controller allows you to access components of your foam 
app by using the browser & displaying it as a GUI. 
To access, run the following in the parent directory of foam3:

* Build java (see above)

* Run foam3/./tools/nanos.sh

* Visit http://localhost:8080/src/foam/nanos/controller/index.html
-->

## Style Guide

All code should follow the [style guide.](doc/guides/StyleGuide.md)

## Testing
<!--
* _npm test_ runs standard unit tests.

* _npm run testDebug_ runs the unit tests with a debugger.

* _npm run coverage_ runs code coverage and creates an html report in /coverage.

For in-browser testing, run your favorite web server at the root of the FOAM
repository. In a browser, navigate to
[http://localhost:8000/test/browser/SpecRunner.html](http://localhost:8000/test/browser/SpecRunner.html)
to run the unit tests.
